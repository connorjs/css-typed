## Usage

### Install

Install the CLI tool as a dev dependency.

```shell
npm install --save-dev css-typed
```

### Run

Run `css-typed` and pass it a glob targeting your CSS files.

```shell
npx css-typed "src/**/*.css"
```

This will generate `.d.css.ts` files next to the original source files.

See the [run script recipe](#run-script) for adding to your `package.json`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> A CSS module file with the name `foo.module.css` will emit `foo.module.d.css.ts`.

### Configure

Configure TypeScript to allow arbitrary extensions (TS 5+).

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"allowArbitraryExtensions": true
	}
}
```

Add `*.d.css.ts` to your `.gitignore` if appropriate.
(See [#4] for more information about alternative output directory.)

```shell
echo '*.d.css.ts' >> .gitignore
```

## Options

The following table lists the options `css-typed` supports.
Also run `css-typed -h` on the command line.

|      CLI option      |   Default    | Description                            |
| :------------------: | :----------: | :------------------------------------- |
|  `-c` or `--config`  |  Heuristics  | Custom path to the configuration file. |
| `--localsConvention` | `dashesOnly` | Style of exported class names.         |

### config

`css-typed` supports loading options from a configuration file instead of using command line arguments.
To load from a custom path, use the `-c` or `--config` option.
By default, `css-typed` looks in the following locations.
Extensionless "rc" files can have JSON or YAML format.

- Package file: `css-typed` property in `package.json` or `package.yaml`
- Root rc files: `.csstypedrc` with no extension or one of `json`, `yaml`, `yml`, `js`, `cjs`, or `mjs`
- Config folder rc files: `.config/csstypedrc` with no extension or one of `json`, `yaml`, `yml`, `js`, `cjs`, or `mjs`
- Root config files: `css-typed.config` with an extension of `js`, `cjs`, or `mjs`

<details>
<summary>Look under the hood</summary>

Under the hood, `css-typed` uses [lilconfig] to load configuration files.
It supports YAML files via [js-yaml].

See [config.ts](src/cli/config.ts) for the implementation.

### localsConvention

Inspired by [postcss localsConvention](https://github.com/madyankin/postcss-modules#localsconvention).
Adds `none` option value to use the class name as-is.

The `--localsConvention` option changes the style of exported class names, the exports in your TS (i.e., the JS names).

`css-typed` will only camelize dashes in class names by default (the `dashesOnly` option value).
It will not preserve the original class name.
For example, `my-class` becomes `myClass` and you cannot use `my-class` in JS/TS code.

Modern bundlers or build system such as Vite and Gatsby support this transformation.
The default matches CSS naming practices (`kebab-case`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Note that `camelCase` and `dashes` MAY have TypeScript bugs.
> TypeScript 5.6 may help with the named exports for these.
>
> If you encounter a bug, please file an issue.
> In the mean-time, consider using `camelCaseOnly` instead.
> (Or `dashesOnly` which is the default.)

## Recipes

### Run script

To run it as part of your build, you will likely include it as a run script, maybe as `codegen`, `css-typed`, or `pretsc`.

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"codegen": "css-typed \"src/**/*.css\"",
		"css-typed": "css-typed \"src/**/*.css\"",
		"pretsc": "css-typed \"src/**/*.css\"",
		"tsc": "tsc"
	}
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Use `\"` in your run scripts for Windows OS compatibility.

### Watch

The CLI does not have built-in watch support.
Feel free to [nodemon] or similar.

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"codegen": "css-typed \"src/**/*.css\"",
		"codegen:watch": "nodemon -x \"npm run codegen\" -w src -e css"
	}
}
```

## Motivation

[typescript-plugin-css-modules] provides a great IDE experience, but cannot perform build-failing type-checking.
Furthermore, the traditional TypeScript ambient module definition fails the `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` strict check and causes issues with typed ESLint rules.

```ts
// This does not provide strict typing
declare module "*.module.css" {
	const classes: { [key: string]: string };
	export default classes; // It also uses default export üòø
}
```

[typed-css-modules] and [typed-scss-modules] exist, but the former does not have recent activity and the latter focuses on SCSS.
(My current (2023/2024) interests involve modern CSS only.)
Both depend on [css-modules-loader-core], which appears [abandoned][174].

Therefore, I wrote my own (very basic) implementation.
See [¬ßImplementation details](#implementation-details) for more information.

## Implementation details

This (very basic) implementation uses [glob] for file matching and [css-tree] for CSS parsing.
It extracts CSS classes (`ClassSelector` in CSS Tree‚Äôs AST) and exports them as `string` constants (named exports).

The CSS-file class name is modified for JS export according to the [localsConvention](#localsconvention) option.
The implementation matches PostCSS.

I chose CSS Tree after a brief search because it had a nice API, good documentation, and supported CSS nesting (a requirement for my original use case).

`css-typed` uses [Commander.js][commander] for command line parsing and [lilconfig] for configuration file loading.

The ‚Äúbrand‚Äù image/logo combines the public CSS 3 and TypeScript logos with a basic plus icon in between.
